%\section{Erklärung zur eigenständigen Arbeit }
%I declare that I wrote my thesis by myself and that I did not use other references or auxiliary aids which I did not quote. Every passage, which I took word by word or analogous out of other sources, has been marked properly. The work or a similar work was not submitted before to another examination office.


I hereby declare that the thesis submitted is my own, unaided work, completed without any unpermitted external help. Only the sources and resources listed were used.
