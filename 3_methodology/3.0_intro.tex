All chapters should have a short introduction what the chapter is about and how it is structured, such that for the reader is always clear what to come. Please structure your thesis such, that the argumentation follows a red line an the sequencing makes logically sense! If the thesis has a clear structure and follows an understandable logic, has no grammar issues or formatting errors, then this gives already a positive impression!
