Describe your analysis and your findings in detail. Please be aware that you have to describe all the tables and figures. Do not just add a figure and think it is self-explanatory. Always state what is presented and why it is important in the context of your thesis. 

For the results, please check in more than one of the most recent and important papers regarding your topic, how the results are presented correctly. 

For statistical methods please have a look how to report p-values and if there is a need of additional parameters which should be mentioned (such as degrees of freedom or correlation coefficients) and check carefully how to report them correctly! If you never heard of the \textbf{Multiple Comparison Problem} please check the \textbf{Bonferroni Method} or \textbf{Benjamini-Hochberg} correction. This is often missing in scientific papers or not properly reported. If you run more than one e.g. correlation analysis you need to apply a correction method! 

For machine learning based approaches, also consider to check how to report the results and how to explain them properly. 

\textbf{Answer your research question(s)/hypotheses in this chapter}. For each research question or hypothesis there should be a clear answer written in this chapter! 

In the end of the section, there should be a short summary (conclusion) of the main findings!
